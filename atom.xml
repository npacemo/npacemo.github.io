	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><cite>Anonymous blog comments, vapid video pranks, and lightweight mashups may seem trivial and harmless, but as a whole, this widespread practice of fragmentary, impersonal communication has demeaned interpersonal interaction.<br/>
&mdash;&ndash; <strong>Jason Lanier</strong>, You are not a Gadget. A Manifesto.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>I realize I have never questioned the necessity of having a comments form in a blog. Somehow comments have always been inseparable part of my understanding of the concept of a blog. I hated the blogs and posts that had their comments disabled even though I leave comments rarely. When I&rsquo;ve started setting up this <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress - A blogging framework for hackers">Octopress</a> blog <strong><em>not using</em></strong> <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus - The Web's Community of Communities">Disqus</a> was out of the question. Every blogger loves comments. Presumably they provide the reader with an almost instantaneous connection with the author and vice versa. And you&rsquo;re getting this emotional boost every time you receive an encouraging response. And the more comments I got the better I felt. So what changed my mind about comments&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It started with an annoying technical issue. As of time of writing <em>(Jan 8, 2014)</em> the <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus - The Web's Community of Communities">Disqus</a> comments widgets was causing Google Chrome browsers on Mac OS X to freeze when attempting to load due to a browser-specific security constraint. If I wasn&rsquo;t that obsessive compulsive about having a consistently working blog on the major browsers I might have been able to live with that. But I imagined the situation of opening something in my favorite browser <em>(which is Firefox currently)</em> and getting a 100% reproducible freeze. I don&rsquo;t think I will open it again. That&rsquo;s a scary thought &ndash; to loose a reader because of a darn technical issue. So I had to switch off comments.</p>

<p>I felt really bad about this decision, so I had to fabricate some additional rational reasons. To my surprise these <em>additional reasons</em> were already adopted on a certain non-verbal level in my mind and I had to just step on it to put it in words. The more I think and I write about that, the more comfortable I feel about this decision. I&rsquo;m letting go of this juvenile desire for approval by the crowd and I no longer need to use my comments count as a social currency and quantification of the quality of my blog.</p>

<h2>The reasoning against comments</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Anonymity.</strong> I don&rsquo;t understand why would someone post anonymously unless being really in danger.</li>
<li><strong>Inarticulate responses.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unproductive controversy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The need for moderation.</strong></li>
</ol>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my Christmas vacation I was spending some time thinking and exploring about ways to inspire my team at <a href="http://www.obecto.com/" title="Obecto - Boutique Software Development Company">Obecto</a> to expand its learning bandwidth. This has led me somehow to the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en" title="Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a> and then to the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en/reading" title="Software Craftsmanship - Background Materials">Further Reading Materials</a> where I have found the online version of the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html" title="Apprenticeship Patterns">Apprenticeship Patterns Book</a>. This book has caught my attention right from the start and in the next few days I felt necessary to read the whole book.</p>
