    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In our third edition of the radar, we have attempted to represent the radar in a way more approachable for customers and even non-technical people.
How would you explain what the radar is to someone who&rsquo;s never seen it before?</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>One of the biggest challenges is our industry is how to stay fresh. New technologies, tools and practices are coming in all the time — especially new unproven ones. Technology strategy will be at the core of most business strategies, and it is essential to have a plan how new technology is adopted.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>To answer the question above, at Obecto, we think that the <strong>tech radar</strong> is a really good way to proactively seek for new ways to do our work and bring competitive advantage to our customers, while at the same time maintain focus on what we currently do as standard practices in our industry and maintain the Obecto portfolio of projects in production.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The radar is organised in 4 quadrants:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Languages &amp; Platforms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tools &amp; Frameworks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Techniques &amp; Methodology</strong></li>
<li><strong>Practices</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Within a quadrant there are rings showing the stage of adoption of each point:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Everyday Use</strong> — the final stage of adoption; considered to be our core expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> — used in production projects, but yet to be fully adopted.</li>
<li><strong>Playing with</strong> — still in experimentation and research stage, used only in pet projects.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Languages &amp; Platforms</h2>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/633/22030390419_423bb96fb2_o.png" width="640" height="640" title="Languages & Platforms - Obecto Tech. Radar - May 2015" >
</div>


<p>Some points from this quadrant that are worth highlighting:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Node.js</strong> — as our portfolio of Node.js project grows, this platform is in trend to be fully adopted in the near quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Java 8</strong> — we’re following closely the Java 8 readiness of all frameworks we currently use and plan to migrate existing projects to Java 8.</li>
<li><strong>Android &amp; iOS</strong> — our native apps mobile experience portfolio is not impressive enough to consider this fully adopted. Nevertheless, we feel proficient in both mobile platforms. That’s an expertise not to be underestimated!</li>
<li><strong>Swift</strong> — our next iOS project will be in Swift instead of Objective C.</li>
<li><strong>Clojure, Scala, Erlang</strong> — our team is quite excited about the functional programming languages. The following quarters will show if any new project would be approached with a solution that includes the functional style of programming.</li>
<li><strong>ECMA Script 6</strong> — we’re experimenting with ECMA Script 6 to Javascript compilers that we can use in existing projects.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools &amp; Frameworks</h2>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/592/22029213280_4b0f04cd3f_o.png" width="640" height="640" title="Tools & Frameworks - Obecto Tech. Radar - May 2015" >
</div>


<p>Our current selection of tools and frameworks is optimised for building very efficiently Single Page Applications (SPA) with backends providing REST APIs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symfony 2</strong> — in the current edition of the radar we’re putting on hold Code Igniter taking it out of everyday use. All new PHP projects are started with Symfony. All PHP projects in production have been migrated to Symfony 2.</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> — when it comes to responsive web applications and mobile-first, 2014 was a very busy year for us (for more info check our mobile experience portfolio).</li>
<li><strong>Mongo</strong> — very soon Mongo will get its place in the core ring next to the relational databases we typically use (e.g. MySQL and PostgreSQL).</li>
<li><strong>Cassandra &amp; Hadoop</strong> — even though these are placed in the Proficient ring it worths mentioning that we have over 2 years of experience in using them as part of our custom analytics solution that we built for <a href="http://newstag.com/" title="Newstag - you are it!">Newstag</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Techniques &amp; Methodology</h2>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/672/21594525034_31c532dcc4_o.png" width="640" height="640" title="Techniques & Methodology - Obecto Tech. Radar - May 2015" >
</div>


<p>The process and methodology in Obecto has evolved to support projects of varying complexity and size with ever increasing focus on being as lean as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SCRUM</strong> — we consider ourselves experts in applying the <em>SCRUM framework</em> for projects that need to sustain longer term development.</li>
<li><strong>OOP</strong> — we still feel that the <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> paradigm when combined with good knowledge of the <em>Design Patterns</em> and the <em>SOLID principles</em> gives the most versatile approach for software projects.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive &amp; Mobile-First</strong> — when it comes to responsive web applications and mobile-first, 2014 was a very busy year for us. These two techniques have become a valuable additions to our core expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Development</strong> — that’s a lean startup methodology. Nevertheless, when applied in the context of the early stages of a software project it brings very efficiently validation and verification of the core concepts and assumptions by using a systematic approach.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Practices</h2>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/727/22217268745_14d047471e_o.png" width="640" height="640" title="Practices - Obecto Tech. Radar - May 2015" >
</div>


<p>Practices are specific elements that we use and apply in our software development process, such as how we write, or test, or release our code.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clean Code</strong> — we have projects that need to sustain development in the longer term. Cleanliness of the code is crucial when we need to maintain our productivity in the long term.</li>
<li><strong>TAD</strong> — <em>Testing After Development</em> is a practice where the unit test is written after the actual code, and only specific part of the code are put under such unit testing instead of being in pursuit of 100% code coverage. For many project we have done exactly the opposite and we’re very proficient in <strong>TDD</strong> <em>(Test Driven Development)</em>, as well as writing <em>end-to-end tests</em> with the help of <strong>BDD</strong> <em>(Behaviour Driven Design)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Story Points</strong> — we’re currently playing with Story Points in the practice of estimation and we’re looking forward to use this practice in our customers’ projects.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The November 2014 edition of our <strong>technocalogy radar</strong> is the second edition of the <a href="http://obecto.com" title="My Company">Obecto</a> radar.</p>

<p>It marks few important moments for our organisation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Angular &amp; Dojo 1.8</strong> &ndash; we consider Angular fully adopted and a fine substitute for our previous choice Dojo.</li>
<li><strong>Java 7 &amp; Spring 4</strong> &ndash; both Java and Spring were upgraded to their latest production-ready versions for the active ongoing and coming Java/Spring projects.</li>
<li><strong>Symfony 2</strong> &ndash; we like this framework, because of its architectural resemblance to Spring. This allow us to apply the same architectural principles in our PHP projects. At this point we consider migrating all ongoing PHP projects from <a href="https://codeigniter.com/" title="CodeIngniter Web Framework">CodeIgniter</a> to <a href="https://symfony.com/" title="High-Performance PHP Framework">Symfony 2</a>. Consider checking out the <a href="https://www.buyandsell.ie/" title="Buy &amp; Sell - Ireland">Buy &amp; Sell</a> classifieds platform that Obecto had built entirely with <strong>Symfony 2</strong> from scratch in just about 4.5 months.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Sails.js</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://sailsjs.org/" title="Enterprise-grade Node.js framework">Sails.js</a> has caught our attention for its conceptual succession from Rails and as a build-up on top of <a href="http://expressjs.com/" title="Express - Node.js web application framework">Express.js</a>. We do need something like this in order to streamline the execution of our Node.js projects. In the coming versions of the radar we&rsquo;ll share more deeper observations on the maturity of this framework and its tooling. Stay tuned!</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Flow</strong> &ndash; For simpler projects and simpler deployment setups, our team has found <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" title="Understanding the GitHub Flow">GitHub Flow</a> to be more appropriate and we use it as an alternative to the more disciplined and systematic branching and release models in <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" title="A successful Git branching model">Git Flow</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code Reviews</strong> &ndash; We have done code reviews on and off throughout the years. Time went by, our team continued to expand, and now this practice has become quite essential in our effort to share our craftsmanship mastery to the new members of the team. Furthermore, with <strong>code reviews</strong> we manage to distribute the knowledge in a project, to control the code quality for off-shore team members that are employed by our clients and to mitigate the related risks with that.</li>
<li><strong>Agile Documentation</strong> &ndash; Our understanding of what constitutes a product documentation and how to build it had evolved quite a lot. Originally, we used to base the product documentation on top of the requirement documents with a constant effort to keep things consistent in an ever-changing project with a dynamic backlog of user stories, tasks, epics and bug reports. As an alternative to this approach, we tried to organize the documentation around the most stable user stories and to document at the latest possible moment during a SCRUM sprint, when the functionality is finished, reviewed and deployed. Thus, we have a stable body of knowledge that reflects 100% accurately the end product, instead of being a mash-up between original intentions patched with description of the decision taken during development.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a story of how overconfidence and being too skilled can sometimes cloud your judgement for the bigger picture. A story of how our company has managed to leave a train that was heading towards the end of its railroad. And how we learned to prevent that from happening again.</p>

<p>We started <a href="http://obecto.com" title="My Company">Obecto</a> at the fall of 2008. During the period of 2008-2012, we were particularly focused on growing our company&rsquo;s Flex expertise. For those that had never heard of Flex, this was a front-end technology developed by Adobe. It was comprised of a set of <strong>programming languages</strong> (ActionScript 3 and MXML), a <strong>byte-code execution environment</strong> (Flash &amp; AIR) and a very mature set of quite sophisticated <strong>SDK and frameworks</strong> (Eclipse-base IDE, debugger, profiler, Cairngorm, Parsley, RobotMVC, etc.) As we were growing our expertise we had our own share of contributions to the open source community, namely the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/flit/" title="FLit - a lightweight Flex for Flash Apps">FLit framework &mdash; a light-weight Flex for Flash Applications</a>, which was quite unique.</p>

<p>Our reputation and skill set grew to a point at which VMware trusted us to train over 80 of their finest engineers. We were also invited to taught Flex as a university course at the <em>Sofia University</em>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>We become so damn good at Flex/Flash, and the technology was so powerful <em>(even now the most popular Javascript frameworks are still not providing the same capabilities and levels of productivity)</em>, that our hubris blinded us from seeing the bigger picture and what was really happening in the technology world. We ignored all of the signs, even the total lack of support of Flash on the iOS devices and mobile in general, expecting it to be only temporary situation.</cite></p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>Flex was the answer to all of our needs &mdash; current and future &mdash; you name it: complex web applications, desktop applications and even a viable alternative to native mobile. Despite the unprecedented productivity and technology capabilities of Flex allowing the development of mind-blowing user interactions and user experiences, this technology was very quickly in decline. And it suddenly vanished one day, leaving our company with a portfolio of impressive projects done with a dead technology. We had to start basically from scratch to build a new portfolio that will set us apart and beyond the average software development studio. It took us almost 2 years to regain our reputation as experts in the field and rebuild our portfolio.</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>That thought us an important lesson! Technology companies need a process to continuously assess new technology and discuss potential future directions, while at the same time maintain sharp focus at the technologies offered as main platform choices to their customers.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>As part of such process, at <a href="http://obecto.com" title="My Company">Obecto</a>, we decided to use a tool called <strong>Technology Radar</strong>. For those readers, unfamiliar with this tool and its concept, we suggest you to read <a href="http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html" title="Build Your Own Technology Radar">Build Your Own Technology Radar</a> <em>by Neil Ford</em>.</p>

<p>In short, the <strong>radar</strong> as <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="ThoughtWorks corporate site">ThoughtWorks</a>, the company that invented it, defines it is:</p>

<blockquote><p><cite>&hellip;a document that sets out the changes that we think are currently interesting in software development &ndash; things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects. It reflects the idiosyncratic opinion of a bunch of senior technologists based on our day-to-day work and experiences.<br/>
&mdash;&ndash; <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong>, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq" title="ThoughtWorks -- Technology Radar FAQ">Technology Radar &ndash; FAQ</a> </cite></p></blockquote>

<p>So let us present you our first version of the Obecto technology radar:</p>

</div>


<p>The first edition of our radar marks few important moments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flash/Flex</strong> &ndash; our departure from Flex/Flash has completed and it has deserved its honourable place in the graveyard of good technologies. Nonetheless, we&rsquo;re still continuing to support a couple of AIR desktop applications for the pharmaceutical industry.</li>
<li><strong>Spring-Roo</strong> &ndash; even though <em>spring-roo</em> has saved us numerous hours of coding by generating the boilerplate and necessary plumbing for us, it has reached a point where projects that are using <em>spring-roo</em> are very difficult to maintain as tooling. The tooling behaves inconsistently across different versions and especially when combined with <strong>Eclipse STS</strong>. The <strong>Spring frameworks</strong> had matured to a level where we no longer need <em>spring-roo</em>. No new projects will be started with <em>spring-roo</em> and we already started an initiative to get rid of <em>spring-roo</em> from all active projects.</li>
<li><strong>Angular.JS</strong> &ndash; as we no longer relied on the use of <em>Flex/Flash</em> for building web applications, we have adopted <em>Dojo 1.8</em> as one of our core technologies for building SPA <em>(Single Page Applications)</em>. Since the beginning of the 2014 we have spotted <em>Angular.JS</em> as a better alternative to <em>Dojo</em> and since then it is in a process of active adoption in the organisation. All new web application projects are using <em>Angular.JS</em>.</li>
<li><strong>JSP/JSF</strong> &ndash; using server-side generated pages still has its place in certain solutions. But the JSF technology is not intended to be the most performing web technology. Also as an enterprise technology it relies on providing sufficient hardware to run it. There is always some room for performance optimization, but regardless of performance there are certain limitations when trying to implement more sophisticated interaction design and UX, such as applying the <strong>mobile-first</strong> technique.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js</strong> &ndash; after few successful pilot projects, we do believe in the pursuit of a <strong>full Javascript</strong> technology stack. One programming language used across all application layers. With some rough edges for operations and DevOps, it is time to put <em>Node.js</em> through a trial of several bit more complex projects.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><cite>Anonymous blog comments, vapid video pranks, and lightweight mashups may seem trivial and harmless, but as a whole, this widespread practice of fragmentary, impersonal communication has demeaned interpersonal interaction.<br/>
&mdash;&ndash; <strong>Jason Lanier</strong>, You are not a Gadget. A Manifesto.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>I realize I have never questioned the necessity of having a comments form in a blog. Somehow comments have always been inseparable part of my understanding of the concept of a blog. I hated the blogs and posts that had their comments disabled even though I leave comments rarely. When I&rsquo;ve started setting up this <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress - A blogging framework for hackers">Octopress</a> blog <strong><em>not using</em></strong> <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus - The Web's Community of Communities">Disqus</a> was out of the question. Every blogger loves comments. Presumably they provide the reader with an almost instantaneous connection with the author and vice versa. And you&rsquo;re getting this emotional boost every time you receive an encouraging response. And the more comments I got the better I felt. So what changed my mind about comments&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It started with an annoying technical issue. As of time of writing <em>(Jan 8, 2014)</em> the <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus - The Web's Community of Communities">Disqus</a> comments widgets was causing Google Chrome browsers on Mac OS X to freeze when attempting to load my blog <em>(and in fact any blog with a <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus - The Web's Community of Communities">Disqus</a> widget on it)</em> due to a browser-specific security constraint. If I wasn&rsquo;t that obsessive compulsive about having a consistently working blog on the major browsers I might have been able to live with that. But I imagined the situation of opening something in my favorite browser <em>(which is Firefox currently)</em> and getting a 100% reproducible freeze. I don&rsquo;t think I will open it again. That&rsquo;s a scary thought &ndash; to loose a reader because of a darn technical issue. So I had to switch off comments.</p>

<p>I felt really bad about this decision, so I had to fabricate some additional rational reasons. To my surprise these <em>additional reasons</em> were already adopted on a certain non-verbal level in my mind and I had to just step on it to put it in words. The more I think and I write about that, the more comfortable I feel about this decision. I&rsquo;m letting go of this juvenile desire for approval by the crowd and I no longer need to use my comments count as a social currency and quantification of the quality of my blog.</p>

<h2>The reasoning against comments</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Anonymity.</strong> I don&rsquo;t understand why would someone post anonymously unless being really in danger. Instead people use anonymity to detach the nasty things they type on their keyboards from their identity. It&rsquo;s defacing the conversation and stimulates behavior I don&rsquo;t want to be part of.</li>
<li><strong>Inarticulate responses.</strong> Comments rarely are the place where you can read a response that has took days or even an hour of reflection before the responder formulates his words. Usually, they express a basic primary reaction. It&rsquo;s like a shout in a room full of people. It doesn&rsquo;t contribute much to the presented material and it&rsquo;s a relatively poor attempt at establishing a connection. I&rsquo;m longing for a deeper relationship. Take for example the way the life-long conversation between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud was depicted in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571222/" title="A Dangerous Method (2011) - IMDb">A Dangerous Method (2011)</a>. I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the intensity and especially the civility and great mutual respect in this relationship. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be able to find many such examples where great minds have been able to keep alive a correspondence of enormous value and beauty, but this rarely happens in the form of exchanging few comments at the bottom part of a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Unproductive controversy.</strong> I don&rsquo;t mind someone expressing a strong disagreement. Sometimes titles are designed to be provocative. But I do mind against controversy in the lines of Mac vs. PC, C# vs. Java, OOP vs. Functional, Vim vs. Emacs, Comments Off vs. Comments On etc. Often <em>(but not always)</em> such controversy is unproductive and shallow.</li>
<li><strong>The need for moderation.</strong> Moderation is an overhead activity that I would be happy not to do. Keeping the comments clean of spam and irrelevant comments is a distractive task I want to avoid.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Better ways to respond</h2>

<p>Switching off comments doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to prevent any kind of conversation happening. On the contrary, I want the conversations to be deeper, more personal instead of fragmentary and impersonal.</p>

<p>In case you have read a post here and you want to reply, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Blog about it.</strong> Writing is tough. Finding the right words is tough. But when the magic happens, the effects of a good blog post could pay you back in the long-term. Please, don&rsquo;t forget to let me know about your post. You can do this via email or a tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Reply on Twitter.</strong> You can either use the &lsquo;Tweet&rsquo;-button at the bottom of an article, or tweet to <a href="http://twitter.com/npacemo" title="Follow me on Twitter">my Twitter account (@npacemo)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Email me.</strong> You can find my contacts on the <a href="/about" title="About Vladimir Tsvetkov">About</a> page.</li>
</ol>


<p>Let&rsquo;s push it harder for some next level conversations!</p>
