My name is Vladimir Tsvetkov. I'm a software engineer-practitioner-programmer, computer scientist and UX design enthusiast. I'm building software that delivers valuable change to the world. I live in Sofia, Bulgaria with my wife and my daughter.

### Personal

I'm a strong believer in that programming languages are more than a way to instruct hardware what to do, but rather a formal medium for expressing powerful ideas about methodology. I try to pursue meaning in my everyday activities and as much as possible to consciously shape my intents and understandings of the world, life and work. I'm one of the many people on Earth that are still struggling to find the line of hacks that would allow me to really contribute and be really useful instead of just linger through mundane tasks and necessities of imminent survival. I'm passionate about systems thinking and developing design awareness and sensibility for the value of things in a world of relativity and wastefulness. I'm a husband and a father. I'm a former short track speed skating national competitor and currently a competitor steward referee. I love running, building LEGO with my kid and I'm an espresso fanatic.

### Professional

My professional experience started at the end of 2005 and since then I had the chance to exercise virtually all roles and responsibilities involved in the completion of a software product. I'm a Co-Founder and VP Engineering of [Obecto][obecto] - a boutique software development company that's helping many startups realize their ideas ranging from massive online video conferencing to operation of hydrothermal carbonization plants. I'm also a Co-Owner and Co-Creator of [SEC Live][seclive] - a company set off to improve the way investors, analysts and fund managers work by fusing big data processing and great UX.
