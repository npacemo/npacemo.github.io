My work explores different ways how to focus on value creation, where business, design and software merge. I oppose to the traditional ways of delivering software. Our industry overdelivers in terms of software getting built, and tremendously underdelivers in terms of value and impact. My mission is to find the most talented software teams out there and to drive their transformation. So that they can stop just churning source code and features, but design powerful collaborations with their clients and users, and start building impactful digital products that deliver valuable change to the world.

### Professional Experience

My professional experience started at the end of 2005 and since then I had the opportunity to perform essentially all roles, activities and responsibilities involved in the completion of a software product, as well as to operate and run a software services company. I was a Co-Founder, then VP Engineering, and lastly a CEO at Obecto - a boutique software development company that was helping many startups realize their ideas such as:

* massive online video conferencing
* maintenance, operation and management of plants that turn organic waste into coal
* innovating the distribution models for high-quality news video content 
* etc.

I was also a shareholder and core team member at [SEC Live][seclive] - a company set off to improve the work of investors, analysts and fund managers by fusing machine learning, big data processing and user experience. 

I'm currently a Co-Founder and President & COO at [Hacker Works][hacker-works].
