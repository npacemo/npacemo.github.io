The November 2014 edition of our **technocalogy radar** is the second edition of the [Obecto][obecto] radar. 

It marks few important moments for our organisation:

* **Angular & Dojo 1.8** - we consider Angular fully adopted and a fine substitute for our previous choice Dojo.
* **Java 7 & Spring 4** - both Java and Spring were upgraded to their latest production-ready versions for the active ongoing and coming Java/Spring projects.
* **Symfony 2** - we like this framework, because of its architectural resemblance to Spring. This allow us to apply the same architectural principles in our PHP projects. At this point we consider migrating all ongoing PHP projects from [CodeIgniter][codeigniter] to [Symfony 2][symfony]. Consider checking out the [Buy & Sell][buyandsell] classifieds platform that Obecto had built entirely with **Symfony 2** from scratch in just about 4.5 months.

* **Sails.js** - [Sails.js][sailsjs] has caught our attention for its conceptual succession from Rails and as a build-up on top of [Express.js][expressjs]. We do need something like this in order to streamline the execution of our Node.js projects. In the coming versions of the radar we'll share more deeper observations on the maturity of this framework and its tooling. Stay tuned!
* **GitHub Flow** - For simpler projects and simpler deployment setups, our team has found [GitHub Flow][githubflow] to be more appropriate and we use it as an alternative to the more disciplined and systematic branching and release models in [Git Flow][gitflow]. 
* **Code Reviews** - We have done code reviews on and off throughout the years. Time went by, our team continued to expand, and now this practice has become quite essential in our effort to share our craftsmanship mastery to the new members of the team. Furthermore, with **code reviews** we manage to distribute the knowledge in a project, to control the code quality for off-shore team members that are employed by our clients and to mitigate the related risks with that.
* **Agile Documentation** - Our understanding of what constitutes a product documentation and how to build it had evolved quite a lot. Originally, we used to base the product documentation on top of the requirement documents with a constant effort to keep things consistent in an ever-changing project with a dynamic backlog of user stories, tasks, epics and bug reports. As an alternative to this approach, we tried to organize the documentation around the most stable user stories and to document at the latest possible moment during a SCRUM sprint, when the functionality is finished, reviewed and deployed. Thus, we have a stable body of knowledge that reflects 100% accurately the end product, instead of being a mash-up between original intentions patched with description of the decision taken during development.
