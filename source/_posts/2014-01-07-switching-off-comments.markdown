I realize I have never questioned the necessity of having a comments form in a blog. Somehow comments have always been inseparable part of my understanding of the concept of a blog. I hated the blogs and posts that had their comments disabled even though I leave comments rarely. When I've started setting up this [Octopress][octopress] blog ***not using*** [Disqus][disqus] was out of the question. Every blogger loves comments. Presumably they provide the reader with an almost instantaneous connection with the author and vice versa. And you're getting this emotional boost every time you receive an encouraging response. And the more comments I got the better I felt. So what changed my mind about comments...

<!-- more -->

It started with an annoying technical issue. As of time of writing *(Jan 8, 2014)* the [Disqus] comments widgets was causing Google Chrome browsers on Mac OS X to freeze when attempting to load due to a browser-specific security constraint. If I wasn't that obsessive compulsive about having a consistently working blog on the major browsers I might have been able to live with that. But I imagined the situation of opening something in my favorite browser *(which is Firefox currently)* and getting a 100% reproducible freeze. I don't think I will open it again. That's a scary thought - to loose a reader because of a darn technical issue. So I had to switch off comments.

I felt really bad about this decision, so I had to fabricate some additional rational reasons. To my surprise these *additional reasons* were already adopted on a certain non-verbal level in my mind and I had to just step on it to put it in words. The more I think and I write about that, the more comfortable I feel about this decision. I'm letting go of this juvenile desire for approval by the crowd and I no longer need to use my comments count as a social currency and quantification of the quality of my blog.

## The reasoning against comments

1. **Anonymity.** I don't understand why would someone post anonymously unless being really in danger.
1. **Inarticulate responses.**
1. **Unproductive controversy.**
1. **The need for moderation.**
