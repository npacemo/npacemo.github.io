During my Christmas vacation I was spending some time thinking and exploring about ways to inspire my team at [Obecto][obecto] to expand its learning bandwidth. This has led me somehow to the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto][manifesto] and then to the [Further Reading Materials][reading-materials] where I have found the online version of the [Apprenticeship Patterns Book][apprenticeship-patterns]. This book has caught my attention right from the start and in the next few days I felt necessary to read the whole book.
