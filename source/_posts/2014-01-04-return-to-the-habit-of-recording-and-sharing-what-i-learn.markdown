During my Christmas vacation I was spending some time thinking and exploring about ways to inspire my team at [Obecto][obecto] to expand its learning bandwidth. This has led me somehow to the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto][manifesto] and then to the [Further Reading Materials][reading-materials] where I have found the online version of the [Apprenticeship Patterns Book][apprenticeship-patterns]. This book has caught my attention right from the start and in the next few days I felt necessary to read the whole book. 

Reading it led me to inspiration and many ideas about initiatives and ways to approach the learning process within my team. But more importantly, it helped me reignite and start [nurturing my passion][nurture-your-passion] for the craft again. It led me to some important reflections and it reminded me about my [long road][the-long-road].

## Important reflections and realizations

1. **I need to regain the *sense of control* and responsibility for my learning process.** It's not that I'm not doing any learning... Looking at 2013 in retrospect, I've been involved in quite a lot of learning activities. I attended a [Clojure programming][fmi-clojure] course at the Sofia University. I didn't finished the course, but managed to pull it through the 60% of the course curriculum and home work assignments. Roughly, at the same time I've enrolled the [Functional Programming Principles in Scala][progfun] course at [Coursera][coursera]. Again and sadly, I didn't finished the course and I haven't submitted the Week 6 and Week 7 assignments on time. I realise now that both of these learning efforts were not-that-well-thought-through attempts to [expand my bandwidth][expand-your-bandwidth]. Both of them failed because they didn't fit into a **sustainable learning strategy** that was considering realistically how much time and energy I'm investing in my companies. My projects at that time entered a phase that required 110% of my attention and I had to assign low priority to my learning activities... And this is how my *deliberate learning* for 2013 just ceased. Both my Clojure and Scala skills now would take some considerable time to recover. But again recovering those would be in vain if I don't spend some time to [draw my own map][draw-your-own-map] and see where does, for example, the skill of Clojure programming fits into my overall career strategy. The [Apprenticeship Patterns Book][apprenticeship-patterns] helped me realize that from now I should strive not just to spend time on learning new and interesting stuff, but rather approach learning in a way more systematic fashion by implementing a whole micro-architecture of related learning patterns,  supporting practices and even habits.
1. **Lots of reusable and transferable knowledge I've lost unrecorded.** I have lost the count of how many times I've decided that there's no time to record a lessons I've learned. And later I run repeatedly into a situation where I have to either learn the same lesson again or I have to recollect the details of a solution by digging really deep into my faded memories. Sometimes it is something as small as a specific shell command that is useful in a certain situation, but sometimes it is something bigger such as a non-obvious architectural solution that takes into consideration a number of undocumented technical constraints. In all of these situations I have to invest a lot of effort. I feel especially bad when I recall [Larry Wall][larry-wall] who encourages every programmer to develop the [three great virtues][the-virtues] of our craft: *laziness, impatience, and hubris*. He says about ***laziness***, *"that this is the quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer."* It's unrealistic to expect that I'll be able to record absolutely all lessons I'm learning in my everyday work, but now I'm determined to record as much as I can. Hacking this blog together is a step forwards in the way of achieving this goal. I used to have a blog with articles mostly on *Flash and Flex* *(which is no longer accessible - http://npacemo.com/)*, you know, and it was popular enough for me to feel that I'm doing a decent job with it. Gradually I was writing less and less frequently, until I totally stopped and the content in my blog eventually became irrelevant. My point is *if I fail to form the habit of [recording what you learn][record-what-you-learn]* this blog will most likely fall into the steps of my former one. Currently, I'm learning more and more about habit formation and this gives me a bit more confidence.
1. **Taking a [different road][a-different-road] doesn't mean I've lost [my long road][the-long-road].**
